Advanced Data Analytics project on NYC Taxi Trips 2021, employing Python for comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling with machine learning techniques.

Advanced Data Analytics for NYC Taxi Trips

Project Overview

This project analyzes the New York City taxi trip dataset for the year 2021. It focuses on cleaning, processing, exploring, and modeling the data to predict various outcomes related to taxi trips and mainly to aid with understanding keay factors influencing the taxi trip pricing and what influences it by using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of over 30 million records, detailing aspects such as pickup and dropoff times, locations, distances traveled, fares, and more.

Dataset

The data is sourced from the NYC Open Data portal and has been pre-processed into four partitions to manage the large volume. Each file contains detailed trip records including:

VendorID
tpep_pickup_datetime
tpep_dropoff_datetime
passenger_count
trip_distance
RatecodeID
store_and_fwd_flag
PULocationID
DOLocationID
payment_type
fare_amount
extra
mta_tax
tip_amount
tolls_amount
improvement_surcharge
total_amount
congestion_surcharge
