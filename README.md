# Advanced Data Analytics for NYC Taxi Trips

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the New York City taxi trip dataset for the year 2021, employing Python for comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling with machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand key factors influencing taxi trip pricing and other related outcomes. The dataset includes over 30 million records, detailing pickup and dropoff times, locations, distances traveled, fares, and more.

## Dataset
The data is sourced from the NYC Open Data portal and has been pre-processed into four partitions to manage the large volume. Each file contains detailed trip records including:
- VendorID
- tpep_pickup_datetime
- tpep_dropoff_datetime
- passenger_count
- trip_distance
- RatecodeID
- store_and_fwd_flag
- PULocationID
- DOLocationID
- payment_type
- fare_amount
- extra
- mta_tax
- tip_amount
- tolls_amount
- improvement_surcharge
- total_amount
- congestion_surcharge
